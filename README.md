# Wiki-API

## The program parses Wikipedia of a chosen country and gives you the number of views on a page with a requested title, of a requested year; then saves history of requests and outputs in SQLite database.

This is a project, that I made in 2022 to practice my data parsing and storing skills. 

I've found a free API, that didn't need a key and wrote the code, that would take initial link, ask you some questions and complete the link based on your answers. Then it would retrieve data from the link, print it and store all the data in SQLite database.

There are a lot of useful comments in the code, where you can also find all the used links (some of them may not be working by the time you read this)
